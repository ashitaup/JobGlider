JobGlider: The smart way to manage your job search. No more spreadsheets, no more hassle. Just apply and let JobGlider do the rest!

Searching for a job can be a daunting and stressful task. There are many factors to consider, such as finding the right opportunities, crafting the perfect resume and cover letter, tracking the status of each application, and preparing for interviews. It can be hard to keep track of all the information and deadlines, especially when applying to multiple jobs at once.
In this case study, we will walk you through the process of designing and developing JobGlider, from the initial research and ideation to the final prototype and testing. We will explain the methods and tools used, the challenges faced, and the insights gained along the way. We will also share the feedback received from potential users and the next steps for improving the product.
That is why we designed JobGlider, a platform that helps you manage your job search in a smart and efficient way. JobGlider is a web-based application that allows you to organize and monitor your job applications in one place. You can easily add new applications, update existing ones, and view the progress of each application. JobGlider will also automatically notify you of any changes in the status of your applications, whether they are applied, not selected, or scheduled for an interview. You can also set reminders and add notes to each application to help you stay on top of your tasks and goals.

Our journey with JobGlider began with a comprehensive competitive analysis. By dissecting the strengths and weaknesses of key players like Simplify, Jotterwolf, Huntr, Teal, Stipplo, Jobscan, and Wonsulting.ai, we gained invaluable insights into the existing job search landscape. This analysis extended to indirect competitors such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Wellfound, Notion, and even the versatile Excel Sheet.

Upon analyzing the current landscape, it's evident that many job search platforms emphasize application tracking and document management, overlooking crucial factors that contribute to a user's overall job-seeking experience. Few platforms integrate a strong community feature or consider the benefits associated with a successful job search.
The opportunity for JobGlider lies in providing users with more than just a streamlined application process. Differentiation can be achieved by placing a significant emphasis on creating a platform that goes beyond logistics, therefore we have marketed our product mostly on automatic job application tracking compared to our competitors providing just manual drag/drop tracking, also added is the “Reminders” feature. Based on the User Interviews conducted by our team we found “Reminders” was the first priority for almost every user. Incorporating a visualization of progress can serve as a powerful incentive, motivating users to stay engaged in their job search journey, we have implemented this using the “Dashboard” page of our platform.
JobGlider should aim to create a platform that not only simplifies the logistics of job searching but also injects a sense of motivation, enjoyment, and community into the process. The platform's vibe should be fun and simple, ensuring that users not only efficiently manage their job applications but also find a supportive and engaging environment that encourages long-term engagement.

Prototype:
● Application Tracker: This platform can automatically track the status of users’ job applications. The tracker includes details like the company name, position applied for, and places it into a section (Applied, Heard Back etc) based on the current stage of the application process. Clicking on an application reveals a more detailed view, offering insights into the application description.
● Reminders: This feature assists users in managing key milestones such as scheduled interviews, pending applications, and upcoming assessments. Users can view the assessments they need to complete, their deadlines, and receive reminders, and easily prioritize tasks based on time remaining, ensuring they stay organized and on top of their job search activities.
● Contacts: The Contacts feature enables users to categorize and tag their professional network. Users can create custom tags, making it easy to filter and locate contacts based on specific criteria.
● User Dashboard: The user is welcomed to a personalized dashboard that displays key metrics such as the number of applications, pending assessments, and recent job applications. A graphical representation of their job application progress, categorized by stages like applied, pending, and rejected, provides an at-a-glance overview.
● Documents: JobGlider keeps users organized with a dedicated document repository. Resumes, cover letters, and other essential documents are securely stored and easily accessible. The platform supports multiple file formats, making it a one-stop solution for managing application materials.
● LinkedIn Integration: Users can seamlessly connect their LinkedIn profile to JobGlider, enabling quick access to professional details and recommendations.
● Key details: Users can add cards in their application tracker to manually add any application, and they can also add manual reminders in their reminders section.

JobGlider's prototype development prioritizes a user-centric design, seamless integration of features, and innovative visualizations to create a comprehensive job search platform. The combination of contact management, document organization, and proactive reminders positions JobGlider as a holistic solution for effective career management.

User Research Study:
The hypotheses were tested to gauge users' reactions and sentiments towards the proposed value proposition and key features. Hypothesis #1, focusing on the value proposition of JobGlider as "The smart way to manage your job search," aimed to test the appeal of the product's simplification of the job application process. The results indicate that 80% of the feedback was positive, suggesting that the value proposition resonated well with users. Hypotheses #3 and #4, related to the contact management features and it being the top priority for our scope of users, were not validated, indicating a misalignment between assumptions and user preferences. Further exploration is needed to understand the factors influencing users' perceptions of these features. Finally, Hypothesis #4, addressing the prioritization of features, also received 66% positive feedback for the Reminders feature. This suggested a need to redesign our prototype based on the significance of contacts, recommendation engines, and reminders within the application, so we did remove the Job Recommendations feature as it did not showcase its importance based on the interviews conducted and deprioritized Contacts. Overall, the study revealed both validated and invalidated hypotheses, emphasizing the importance of iterative refinement based on user feedback to align the platform's offerings with user expectations.
